# Crypto Arbitrage

---


## About This Program

This program involves collecting data from two different Bitcoin exchanges, Bitstamp and Coinbase, and determining if there are any opportunities for arbitrage. First the data is collected, then it is cleaned up by removing erroneous and duplicated data, and then it is analyzed using summary statistics  and graphical visualizations. If one is lucky enough to find an opportunity for arbitrage, calculations can be done to determine the net gain!
